SMS Spam Detection System
Overview
The SMS Spam Detection System is a machine learning project aimed at classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). This system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze text data, followed by training a machine learning model to perform the classification task.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The system cleans and prepares the SMS dataset by removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the messages.
Text Vectorization: It employs the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert text data into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Training: The system trains a machine learning model using the processed data to distinguish between spam and ham messages.
Evaluation: It evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
To run the SMS Spam Detection System, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Anirudhsahu/SMSS.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd SMSS
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook SMS.ipynb
This will open the notebook in your default web browser, where you can execute the cells to run the SMS Spam Detection System.
